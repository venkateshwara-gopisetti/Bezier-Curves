# Bézier-Curves
### Python implementation for Bezier curves.

<br>

A __Bézier curve__ (/ˈbɛz.i.eɪ/ BEH-zee-ay) is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields. A set of discrete "control points" defines a smooth, continuous curve by means of a formula. Usually the curve is intended to approximate a real-world shape that otherwise has no mathematical representation or whose representation is unknown or too complicated. Bézier curve is named after French engineer Pierre Bézier, who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars. Other uses include the design of computer fonts and animation. Bézier curves can be combined to form a Bézier spline, or generalized to higher dimensions to form Bézier surfaces.[3] The Bézier triangle is a special case of the latter.
